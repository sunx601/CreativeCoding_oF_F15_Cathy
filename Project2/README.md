##Project2: Inner Awaken##
It is an video and sound visualization project that combined with my major studio individual project. I am studing future archaeology, this video is showing how future dance can be a ritual to release people's spirits. The visuals are corresposive to the music, also to the outside sound volumn.

visuals are big triangles rotates in z-axis. When the visual grabber higher volumn sound, it will generates more triangles. The video is playing at behind of the visuals.

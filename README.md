Hi my name is Xiaoyin Sun (Cathy). I am a first year graduate student of MFA DT. I came from China, finished my undergraduate study at Pennsylvania State University. My background is graphic design and advertising. I am very new to coding and open frameworks, the semester so far is fine, still learning new stuff hope I can have steady coding skills to create projects at the end of this semester.
